NOTE! music/ folder is not included, as it was over 50mb. I will provide one through email.
Please put the music folder in the root folder.

Before deploying the web page, make sure you have this NPM packet:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
installed globally with the command:

FOR WINDOWS:
npm install --global http-server

FOR MAC:
brew install http-server

To run the application, enter the root directory in a command line an simply run:
http-server

This should open the app on localhost through Python. I recommend using CHROME.
Set to always allow for camera permission. Wait a bit for the camera viewfinder to load.
